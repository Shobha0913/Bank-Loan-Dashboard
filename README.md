I created an interactive Bank Loan Report Dashboard using Microsoft Power BI, with data sourced and processed from SQL Server. The goal of this project was to provide a clear picture of loan applications, funding amounts, and repayment statuses across different customer segments. The dashboard is divided into three pages – Summary, Overview, and Details – to give a complete and easy-to-understand analysis of the bank's loan performance.

The data was stored in SQL Server, and I connected it directly to Power BI using the built-in SQL Server connector. I wrote custom SQL queries to clean, filter, and prepare the data before importing it into Power BI for visualization. SQL helped in managing large volumes of data efficiently and allowed me to pull only the relevant fields required for the analysis.

This dashboard helps us understand key insights such as total loan applications (38.6K), funded amounts, received payments, interest rates, and DTI (Debt-to-Income) ratios. It also breaks down loans by state, purpose, term, grade, employment length, and home ownership status. By using interactive visuals like donut charts, bar graphs, maps, and tables.
